# Welcome to Timeline!

[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/crupest-web/Timeline/_apis/build/status/crupest.Timeline?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/crupest-web/Timeline/_build/latest?definitionId=7&branchName=master)

This is the first web app back-end of [me](https://github.com/crupest).

It is written in C# and built with [Asp.Net Core](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore).

The final product is hosting on my [Tencent Cloud](https://cloud.tencent.com/) Cloud Virtual Machine on https://api.crupest.xyz.

Feel free to comment by opening an issue.

`tools/open-code` file is a simple _bash_ script that fixes the problem that _OminiSharp_ in C# extension on vscode can't work using _dotnet_ in Arch official package repository on Arch Linux. See [this page](https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/60903).
