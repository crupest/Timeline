# Welcome to Timeline!

## Overview

This is the first web app of [me](https://github.com/crupest).

The back-end is written in C# and built with [ASP.NET Core](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore).

The front-end is located [here](https://github.com/crupest/Timeline-FrontEnd).

The final product is hosting on my [Tencent Cloud](https://cloud.tencent.com/) Cloud Virtual Machine on https://crupest.xyz .

Feel free to comment by opening an issue.

## About Development

I currently actively develop this app on [CODING](https://coding.net/) for better connection in China and better tasks management, which includes issue track and pull requests. But I regularly sync the github repo manually (as github has no mirror feature). And you can also open issue here and I'll read it.
