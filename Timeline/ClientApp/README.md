This is the first web app front-end of [me](https://github.com/crupest).

It is written with [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

The final product is hosting on my [Tencent Cloud](https://cloud.tencent.com/) Cloud Virtual Machine on https://www.crupest.xyz.

I used to write the website with Angular, you can find the old project [here](https://github.com/crupest/Timeline-App), in which I build full unit tests and CI/CD. But I finally gave up for the complexity. Then I turned to flutter to build an Android app, which can be found [here](https://github.com/crupest/Timeline-Flutter). But as time passed by, it turned out that it is simpler than Angular but still very complicated. In the end, I got here and met React. First I use [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) to bootstrap this and later turn to manually configured Webpack. I also adopt the [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/).
